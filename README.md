# PasswordGen
A password generator that runs on Mac OS

There are 3 modes at the moment (8, 10, and 20) character passwords that you are able to copy with a copy button. I want to add more graphics and make it more
visually appealing, along with adding different modes such as a "blind mode" where you can create a password and copy it without the password displaying on
your screen.
